# What is Recette?
Recette is a react based web app that displays recipes based on food-related keywords. Recette uses the developer bundle of [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) and incorporates the *[Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api)*.

# Inspiration
The project would not have been possible without the tutorial from [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q/featured) over at YouTube. His video titled, *[Build a Recipe App with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9T6YkEDkMo&t=2546s)* is what I used personally to follow along and learn the fundamentals of React.

# Deployment
React follows certain guidelines when needed to be deployed.
