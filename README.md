### Recette is now live - [Recette â€¢ Recipe Finder](https://www.imtiazraqib.com/main-projects/recette/)

## What is Recette?
Recette is a react based web app that displays recipes based on food-related keywords. Recette uses the developer bundle of [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) and incorporates the *[Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api)*.

## Inspiration
The project is setup personally for me to learn React and familiarize myself with the framework. The project would not have been possible without the tutorial from [Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q/featured) over at YouTube. His video titled, *[Build a Recipe App with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9T6YkEDkMo&t=2546s)* is what I used personally to follow along and learn the fundamentals of React.

## Deployment
React follows certain guidelines when needed to be deployed. The [DEV.to article](https://dev.to/crishanks/deploy-host-your-react-app-with-cpanel-in-under-5-minutes-4mf6) by *[crishanks](https://dev.to/crishanks)* helped me understand the process and finally have it live on my personal portfolio domain.
